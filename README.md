Saint Michel Technology Institution aims to enhance the knowledge and skills of students in contemporary programming languages that are currently in high demand within the job market. The task at hand is to design and implement a Windows Form application, named "SMTI Student-Project Management," using Visual Studio 2022, C#, and SQL Server 2019. The application will adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilize a three-tier architecture comprising Data Access Layer (DAL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Functional Requirements:

1.	The system enables teachers, upon successful login, to assign projects to students.
2.	A project may be assigned to multiple students.
3.	Students may participate in multiple projects, with the constraint that the number of projects assigned to a student should not exceed three.
4.	The application allows teachers to list all projects assigned to a specific student.
5.	Teachers can view a comprehensive list of students participating in a given project.
6	After successful login, students can view all projects assigned to them.
7.	Data for teachers, students, and projects is available for system use.

The design and implementation of the SMTI Student-Project Management application will follow an OOP approach, adhering to three-tier architecture:

Data Access Layer (DAL): This layer will handle interactions with the SQL Server 2019 database, ensuring efficient and secure data retrieval and storage.

Business Logic Layer (BLL): Responsible for implementing the business rules and logic of the application, this layer will facilitate the interaction between the GUI and the DAL. It ensures that the application functions in accordance with the specified requirements.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The Windows Form application, developed using Visual Studio 2022 and C#, will provide an intuitive interface for teachers and students to interact with the system. It will enable seamless navigation and execution of the assigned tasks.

By incorporating OOP principles and a three-tier architecture, the SMTI Student-Project Management application will be designed for scalability, maintainability, and efficient management of student projects within the educational institution.
